# Test output for 15 Marketing Developmeny Task

Example project in PHP 7 to demonstrate use of OOP design patterns, extendable api integration functionality and phpunit tests within a Docker container.

# Required Resources

- Docker Compose - https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/

# Running Docker

Run `docker-compose up` from the root directory and this will build the application container, start it, install composer and run phpunit for tests.

There is no API exposed but this could easily expose a port for this or mount php-fpm.
